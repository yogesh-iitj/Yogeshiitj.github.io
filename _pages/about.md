I am a Ph.D. Scholar at [IIT Jodhpur](https://iitj.ac.in/) in Vision, Language, and Learning Group [(VL2G)](https://vl2g.github.io/) under [Dr. Anand Mishra's](https://anandmishra22.github.io/) supervision. Currently, I am working on some exciting research problems in computer vision and NLP. 

Previously, I have completed BSc (H) CS and MSc CS from [Delhi University](http://du.ac.in/) in 2017 and 2019. I have worked on the Text Summarization project as my MSc thesis work under the supervision of [Prof. Vasudha Bhatnagar](http://people.du.ac.in/~vbhatnagar/index.html). 

I have qualified for Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) and Assistant Professor (UGC National Eligibility Test), and GATE CSE.
